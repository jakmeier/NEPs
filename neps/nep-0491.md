## Summary

Non-refundable storage allows to create accounts with arbitrary state for users,
without being susceptible to refund abuse.

This is done by tracking non-refundable balance in a separate field of the
account. This balance is only useful for storage staking and otherwise can be
considered burned.


## Motivation

Creating new accounts on chain costs a gas fee and a storage staking fee. The
more state is added to the account, the higher the storage staking fees. When
deploying a contract on the account, it can quickly go above 1 NEAR per account.

Some business models are okay with paying that fee for users upfront, just to
get them onboard. However, it turns out if you do that today, the user can
delete their new account and refund the storage staking fee to another account
in their control. Thereby taking advantage of the business who sponsored their
account.

While spam avoidance is best handled at the application level, the protocol
should at least allow to create accounts in a way that is not susceptible to
such refund abuse. This would at least change the incentives such that creating
fake users is no longer profitable.

Non-refundable storage staking is a further improvement over
[NEP-448](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/448) (Zero Balance Accounts) which
addressed the same issue. But the limit on the state size of accounts makes it
practically impossible to use sponsored accounts with contracts deployed on
them.

## Specification

Users can opt-in to nonrefundable storage when creating new accounts. For that,
we extend the `Transfer` action with a new field:

```rust
struct Transfer {
    pub deposit: Balance,
    /// If this flag is set, the balance will be added to the receiver's non-refundable balance.
    pub nonrefundable: bool,
}
```

To create a named account today, the typical pattern is a transaction with
`CreateAccount`, `Transfer`, and `AddKey`. To make the funds nonrefundable, one
can use the same pattern with the non-refundable flag set to true:
```json
"Actions": {
  "CreateAccount": {},
  "Transfer": { "deposit": "1000000000000000000000000", "nonrefundable": true },
  "AddKey": { "public_key": ..., "access_key": ... }
}
```

It is also possible it combine nonrefundable balance and normal (refundable)
balance in the same account creation by adding a second `Transfer` action.
```json
"Actions": {
  "CreateAccount": {},
  "Transfer": { "deposit": "1000000000000000000000000", "nonrefundable": true },
  "Transfer": { "deposit": "1000000000000000000000000", "nonrefundable": false },
  "AddKey": { "public_key": ..., "access_key": ... }
}
```

To create implicit accounts, the current protocol requires a single `Transfer`
action without further actions in the same transaction. Setting it to
non-refundable will make the full balance non-refundable. If users want to add
refundable balance, it must done in a second transaction.

If a non-refundable transfer arrives at an account that already exists, it will
fail and the funds are returned to the predecessor.

Finally, when querying an account for its balance, there will be an additional
field `nonrefundable` in the output. Wallets will need to decide how they want
to show it. They could, for example, add a new field called "non-refundable
storage credits".
```js
// Account near
{
  "amount": "68844924385676812880674962949",
  "block_hash": "3d6SisRc5SuwrkJnLwQb3W5pWitZKCjGhiKZuc6tPpao",
  "block_height": 97314513,
  "code_hash": "Dmi6UTRYTT3eNirp8ndgDNh8kYk2T9SZ6PJZDUXB1VR3",
  "locked": "0",
  "storage_paid_at": 0,
  "storage_usage": 2511772,
  "formattedAmount": "68,844.924385676812880674962949",
  // this is new
  "nonrefundable": "0"
}
```


## Reference Implementation

On the protocol side, the change to the `Transfer` struct requires changing the
serialization format. To ensure backwards compatibility, we add a new variant to
`enum Action`:

```rust
enum Action {
  CreateAccount(CreateAccountAction), 
  DeployContract(DeployContractAction),
  FunctionCall(FunctionCallAction),
  // kept for backwards compatibility but new clients should only use `TransferV2`
  Transfer(TransferAction),
  Stake(StakeAction),
  AddKey(AddKeyAction),
  DeleteKey(DeleteKeyAction),
  DeleteAccount(DeleteAccountAction),
  Delegate(super::delegate_action::SignedDelegateAction),
  // this gets added in the end
  TransferV2(TransferActionV2),
}
```

Further, we have to update the account meta data representation in the state
trie to track the non-refundable storage.

```rust
pub struct Account {
    amount: Balance,
    locked: Balance,
    // this field is new
    nonrefundable: Balance,
    code_hash: CryptoHash,
    storage_usage: StorageUsage,
    // the account version will be increased from 1 to 2
    version: AccountVersion,
}
```

The field `nonrefundable` must be added to the normal `amount` and the `locked`
balance calculate how much state the account is allowed to use. The new formula
to check storage balance therefore becomes
```rust
amount + locked + nonrefundable >= storage_usage * storage_amount_per_byte
```

For old accounts that don't have the new field, the non-refundable balance is
always zero.

Conceptually, these are all changes on the protocol level. However,
unfortunately, the account version field is not currently serialized, hence not
included in the on-chain state.

Therefore, as the last change necessary for this NEP, we also introduce a new
serialization format new accounts.
```rust
    // new: prefix with a sentinel value to detect V1 accounts, they will have
    //      a real balance here which is smaller than u128::MAX
    writer.serialize(u128::MAX)?;
    // new: include version number (u8) for accounts with version 2 or more
    writer.serialize(version)?;
    writer.serialize(amount)?;
    writer.serialize(locked)?;
    writer.serialize(code_hash)?;
    writer.serialize(storage_usage)?;
    // new: this is the field we added, the type is u128 like other balances
    writer.serialize(nonrefundable)?;
```

Note that we are not migrating old accounts. Accounts created as version 1 will
remain at version 1. This

A proof of concept implementation for nearcore is available in this PR:

## Security Implications

There is a risk for users to accidentally create accounts with nonrefundable
storage and lose the balance as a consequence. This is mitigated because the
default behavior with `nonrefundable = false` will behave exactly like a normal
transfer and not have this problem.

Otherwise, we were not able to come up with security relevant implications.

## Alternatives

There are small variations in the implementation, and there completely different
ways to look at the problem. Let's start with the small variations first.

### Variation: Allow adding nonrefundable balance to existing accounts

Instead of failing when a non-refundable transfer arrives at an existing
account, we could add the balance to the existing non-refundable balance. This
would be more user flexible to use, as a business can easily add more funds for
storage even after account creation.

The main problems with that are in implementation details. It would allow to add
non-refundable storage to existing accounts, which would require some form of
migration of the all accounts in the state trie.

We could maybe do it lazily, i.e. read account version 1 and automatically
convert it to version 2. However, that would break the assumption that every
logical value in the merkle trie has a unique borsh representation, as there
would be a account version 1 and a version 2 borsh serialization that both map
to the same logical version 2 value.

It is not 100% clear to me, the author, if this is a problem we could work
around. However, the complications it would involve do not seem to be worth it,
given that in the feature discussions nobody saw it as critical to add
non-refundable balance to existing accounts.

Another consideration is user friendliness. When someone wants to create a new
implicit account but the account already exists, the current design will fail
and return the tokens. In the alternative, this tokens would be added to the
refundable storage and no longer be retrievable.

### Variation: Allow refunds to original sponsor

Instead of complete non-refundability, the tokens reserved for storage staking
could be returned to the original account that created the account when an
account is deleted.

The community discussions ended with the conclusion that this feature would
probably not be used and we should not implement it until there is real demand
for it.

### Alternative: Don't use smart contracts on user accounts

Instead of deploying contracts on the user account, one could build a similar
solution that uses zero balance accounts and a single master contract that
performs all smart contract functionality required. This master contract can
implement the [Storage Management]
(https://nomicon.io/Standards/StorageManagement) standard to limit storage usage
per user.

This solution is not as flexible. The master account cannot make cross-contract
function calls with the user id as the predecessor.

### Alternative: Move away from storage staking

We could also abandon the concept of storage staking entirely. However, coming
up with a scalable, sustainable solution that does not suffer from the same
refund problems is hard to come up with.

One proposed design is a combination of sharing code between contracts and zero
balance accounts. Basically, if somehow the deployed code is stored in a way
that does not require storage staking by the user itself, maybe the per-user
state is small enough to fit in the 770 bytes limit of zero balance accounts.
(Questionable for most non-trivial use cases.)

This alternative is much harder to design and implement. The proposal that has
gotten the furthest so far is [Ephemeral
Storage](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/485), which is pretty complicated and
does not have community consensus yet. But even on that, nobody is currently
working on. While we could wait for that to eventually make progress, the
community is held back in their innovation because of the refund problem.

## Future possibilities

- We might want to add the possibility to make non-refundable balance transfers
  from within a smart contract. This would require changes to the WASM smart
  contract to host interface. Since removing anything from there is virtually
  impossible, we shouldn't be too eager in adding it there but if there is
  demand for it, we certainly can do it without much trouble.
- We could later add the possibility to refund the non-refundable tokens to the
  account who sent the tokens initially.
- We could allow sending non-refundable balance to existing accounts.
- If (cheap) code sharing between contracts is implemented in the future, this
  proposal will most likely work well in combination with that. Per-user data
  will still need to be paid for by the user, which could be sponsored as
  non-refundable balance without running into refund abuse.


## Consequences


### Positive

- Businesses can sponsor new user accounts without the user being able to steal
  the sponsored tokens.

### Neutral

- Non-refundable tokens are removed from the circulating supply, i.e. burnt.

### Negative

- Understanding a user's balance become even more complicated than it already
  is. (Instead of only `amount` amd `locked`, there will be a third component.)
- There is no incentive anymore to delete an account and its state when the
  backing tokens are not refundable.


### Backwards Compatibility

We believe this can be implemented with full backwards compatibility.

## Unresolved Issues (Optional)

All of these issues already have a proposed solution above. But nevertheless,
these points are likely to be challenged / discussed:

- Should we allow adding non-refundable balance to existing accounts? (proposal:
  no)
- Should we allow adding more non-refundable balance after account creation?
  (proposal: no)
- Should this NEP include a host function to send non-refundable balance from
  smart contracts? (proposal: no)
- How should a wallet display non-refundable balances? (proposal: up to wallet
  providers, probably a new separate field)
